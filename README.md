# Cryptocurrencies
upsupervised learning about cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a report that shows what cryptocurrencies are currenctly available to trade in the market. Also, to create a classification-system.
## Results
In **Deliverable 1**: The raw data was preprocessed to be able to preform a PCA

In **Deliverable 2**: The data is then reorganized into three PCAs so we can perform the algorithm accurately.

In **Deliverable 3**: Take the three PCAs to create an elbow curve to find the best value for K, to run a K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies' data. Also, to create a new dataframe that includes the predicted clusters and cryptocurrencies features.

In **Deliverable 4**: Create scatter plots to visulaize the distinct groups that correspond to the the principal components and to create a table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies.

## Summary

In summary, we took the raw cryptocurrencies data collected by Accountability Accounting and cleaned the data, reorganized to be able to run models accurately in order to figure out what cryptocurrencies could be used as an investment.
